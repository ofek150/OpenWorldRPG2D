# OpenWorldRPG2D
An unfinished 2D Open world rpg game

This was my first attempt of making 2D Open world rpg game in C++ but I decided to abandon the project 
because I wanted to focus more on polishing my skills by building smaller projects rather than than a project as big as this 
that would take me a lot of time to finish.

You are more than welcome to use what I built to far as a foundation for your own personal/commercial projects.
